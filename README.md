This is a breakout (also known as brick smasher) game built in Racket (a
  spin off of lisp).

This project uses a functional approach to create a game. This is my first
big project in this language and my first real experience with using a
functional paradigm throughout an entire project.

This project was done as a school assignment and is more for demonstration and
practice of functional techniques, rather than a playable game.
